# pushup-counter

When I wake up, and once or twice throughout the day, I do a set of ~10 push-ups. It restores energy and feels good, and it's a nice warmup before a run.

I enjoy doing pushups consistently, but it's hard to count when you're doing them. I like each stage of the pushup to last for two seconds (raised, lowering, lowered, raising--and then repeat). So each pushup lasts eight seconds. 

I couldn't find a fitness app that would allow me to enter the amount of pushups I'd like to do, and then count for me as I did them to keep me on pace. So I coded this one.

Once you set the amount of pushups you'd like to do, it gives you fives seconds to get into place before beginning the workout.
